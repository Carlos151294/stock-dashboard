## Usage

Stock Dashboard has the following features:

* **Authentication**

    When you enter the app, you are directed to the *Login Page*. In order to move to the *Home Page* (main section of the app), you can click on the "Login" button and a new window will be opened so you can enter your Google credentials. If you enter valid credentials, you'll be redirected automatically to the *Home Page* of the app.
    Inside the app, you can see at the top right corner a "Logout" link that allows you to end your session. This will redirect you the the *Login Page*.

    This app makes use of [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) which leverages the standards OAuth 2.0.

* **Data Visualization**

    Once you're successfully authenticated, the app automatically loads some information coming from a [mock endpoint](https://run.mocky.io/v3/cc4c350b-1f11-42a0-a1aa-f8593eafeb1e) and displays it using a **Line Chart**. At the top of the chart you can find two icons which give you the chance to click on any of them depending wether you'd like to visualize the data in a **Line Chart** or an **Area Chart**.

    This app makes use of [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) which is a great tool to integrate charts in React applications.

* **Theming**

    In the *Home Page*, below the "Logout" link, you can find a "Dark Theme" toggle button to change between dark and light themes depending on your preference.
        
    This app makes use of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) which is a great tool to style and build React applications.
